## Overview
This extension allows you to falsify results for the random number block on the home page and the list randomizer.

The expansion was created to demonstrate the possibility of skilful manipulation of results for draws, as well as to encourage participants and organizers to pay attention to the use of well-known services, which provide the ability to view the final results to anyone via a link.
